What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

you can start with tracing files. It makes a new head i guess. from now
you can change and track the changes.

git status will give:
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

it 's some prestate before a commit. In the working directory there are more other files
(possibly). The repository is still empty and waits for the final commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change

with git diff you can see the diffrences between the staging are and the working directory.
wit git --staged you can compare the most recent commit with what you are about to commit.
after you checked it you can see if it is one logical change, not too much changes or
at least an important change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

when you change the code with some experimentation
or maybe anouther language version .
