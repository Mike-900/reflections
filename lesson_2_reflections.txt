What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

you can start with tracing files. It makes a new head i guess. from now
you can change and track the changes.

git status will give:
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

it 's some prestate before a commit. In the working directory there are more other files
(possibly). The repository is still empty and waits for the final commit.
